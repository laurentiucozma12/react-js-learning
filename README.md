# ReactJS Learning
- This project is just for learning purpose.
- Here I will upload everything I learned from [ReactJS Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgkZ7MvWUAA)
## ReactJS
- React is a JavaScript Library, not framework
- React focuses on building web apps using components
- A component is a self-contained section of code that functions as a reusable building block
- Think of a Legos. You could say Lego is similar to react component
- Each Lego represents a section of reusable JavaScript and HTML code
- React uses a syntax extension of JavaScript known as JSX, meaning JavaScript XML
- JSX allows you to write HTML like code within your JavaScript files
- React also uses a virtual DOM, it's a lightweight version of the real DOM of a web page
- We can keep track of any changes made to the virtual DOM and only apply that specific change to the real DOM without needing to refresh the entire page, only that specific section
- This reduces rendering performance overhead
